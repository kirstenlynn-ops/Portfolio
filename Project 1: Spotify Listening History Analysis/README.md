# 🎧 Spotify Listening History Analysis (2022–2025)
## Project Overview

Streaming platforms collect huge amounts of user interaction data, but most listeners rarely get a deeper look at their own habits. Features like _Spotify Wrapped_ are fun and informative, yet they often overlook deeper, time-driven patterns and behavioral insights.

This project analyzes Spotify listening history from two consenting individuals to explore how listening behavior, genre preferences, and audio related charcteristics vary over time. By comparing patterns between users with different listening styles, this project demonstrated how small-scale behavioral data canbe analyzed responsibly and ethically.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Compare listening behavior between two users woth distinct listening styles
- Identify temporal trends in listening behavior across users
(time of day, day of week, seasonal patterns)
- Examine differences in music consumption volume and consistency
- Analyze how audio features differ by:
     - Time of day
     - Listening context
     - User
- Identify habitual vs exploratory listening behaviors
- Demonstrate ethical handling of personal behavioral data

## 🔍 Research Questions & Hypotheses
**Research Question 1:**
How do listening patterns differ between two users across time?
**Hypothesis 1:**
One user will demonstarte more consistent listening patterns across time of day and days of the week, while the other will show higher variability and irregual listening sessions.

**Research Question 2:**
Do users exhibit distinct mood-based habits?
**Hypothesis 2:**
Audio fetaures such as energry and valence will clsuter differently for each user, indictaing personalized mood-based listening patterns rather than random song selection.

**Research Question 3:**
How does listening volumn reflect engagement styles?
**Hypothesis 3:**
One user will show higher overall listening volumn with longer sessions, while the other will exhibit shorter, more frequent listening events.

**Research Question 4:**
How does listening behavior evolve over time within each user?
**Hypothesis 4:**
Over time, each user tends to listen to a more consistent set of artists and genres rather than frequently changing their listening style.
