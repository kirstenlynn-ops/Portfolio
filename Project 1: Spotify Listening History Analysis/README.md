# 🎧 Spotify Listening History Analysis (2022–2025)
## Project Overview

Streaming platforms generate massive amounts of user interaction data, yet most users have limited insight into their own listening habits. While tools like Spotify Wrapped provide high-level summaries, they often lack depth, time-based context, and behavioral insight.

This project analyzes my personal Spotify listening history from 2022–2025 to uncover patterns in music consumption, mood, and engagement over time. Using exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization, this project demonstrates how individual-level behavioral data can be analyzed responsibly and ethically.

🎯 Project Goals
- Identify temporal trends in listening behavior
(time of day, day of week, seasonal patterns)
- Explore shifts in artist and genre preferences over time
- Analyze trends in music consumption volume
- Examine relationships between audio features such as:
     - Energy
     - Valence
      - Tempo
- Demonstrate ethical handling of personal behavioral data

## 🔍 Research Questions & Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1:**
Higher-energy music is more frequently played during daytime and afternoon hours, while lower-energy tracks dominate evening listening.

**Hypothesis 2:**
Certain genres and mood profiles become more prominent during high-stress periods (such as academic semesters) compared to lower-stress periods (such as academic breaks).

🔐 Ethical Considerations & Privacy

This project uses only my personal Spotify streaming history. No other users’ data is included.

Privacy and ethical safeguards include:

- Removal of personally identifying information such as IP addresses, usernames, and device identifiers
- Tracks are analyzed strictly as behavioral data points, not endorsements of lyrical content
- Explicit tracks are included only as part of authentic listening history
- Spotify is credited as the original data source

**Note:**
Some tracks are labeled as explicit and may reference adult themes such as violence, substance use, or mature subject matter.
